      <p > I will build a car for the masses. It will be big enough for a family, but also small enough for a person to drive and care for them. It will be made of the finest materials, the best employees, with the simplest design that modern engineering is capable of inventing. But it will be so cheap that everyone working for a good salary will own one - and enjoy many hours of pleasure under the open sky with his family.</p>
